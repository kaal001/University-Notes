## What is Business?

A **business** is an organized economic activity where individuals or groups produce, buy, or sell goods and services with the primary goal of making a profit. It also plays an important role in satisfying the needs and wants of people in society. Businesses are not just about selling products — they also solve problems, create jobs, support communities, and keep the economy running.

The nature of a business can vary depending on what it offers (goods or services), how it is owned (sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation), and what kind of roles it provides (managerial, technical, operational, etc.). At its core, every business aims to provide value while also generating income.

---

## What Do Businesses Actually Do?

Businesses are usually created by **entrepreneurs** — people who see a gap in the market and build a product or service to meet that need. To do this, businesses must use **inputs** (such as land, labour, capital, and machinery) to produce **outputs** (finished goods or services).

They need to manage their **resources** efficiently to keep costs low and quality high. A successful business will **generate profits**, but to do that, it must also maintain strong relationships with its stakeholders, provide value to customers, and adapt to changes in the environment.

Businesses also impact society in other ways. They offer jobs, pay taxes, create infrastructure, and contribute to the development of the local and global economy.

---

## Who Are the Stakeholders?

**Stakeholders** are individuals or groups who are directly or indirectly affected by the business or have an interest in its success. For example:

- **Customers** want quality products at fair prices.
- **Employees** want fair wages, job security, and a safe workplace.
- **Managers** are responsible for decision-making and ensuring operations run smoothly.
- **Owners** or shareholders invest capital and expect profits in return.
- **Suppliers** provide the goods and materials businesses need.
- **Governments** regulate businesses, collect taxes, and protect public interest.
- **Communities** expect businesses to operate ethically and contribute to social development.
- **Creditors** lend money and want it repaid with interest.

Each stakeholder has different expectations, and balancing them is key to long-term success.

---

## 🏭 What is an Industry?

An **industry** is a collection of businesses that produce similar products or services. For instance, car manufacturers and auto parts producers are part of the **automobile industry**. Industries help organize the economy and create competition among businesses. Understanding the industry helps a business position itself, understand the competition, and plan strategies for growth.

---

## 🔄 Internal and External Influences

Business performance is shaped by two types of factors:

- **Internal influences** come from within the business. This includes management style, employee skills, financial resources, company culture, etc.
- **External influences** come from outside and include competition, market demand, laws, social trends, economic conditions, and technology.

Understanding both is crucial for decision-making and long-term planning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives and Strategy

Every business sets goals called **objectives**. Common objectives include:

- **Profit** – To earn more revenue than costs.
- **Survival** – Especially important for startups or during economic crises.
- **Growth** – Businesses aim to expand their size, reach, and market share.
* **Social responsibility** – Many modern businesses also aim to be ethical and sustainable.

To achieve these objectives, businesses design a **strategy** — a set of long-term plans and decisions about how to compete, where to operate, and how to use resources effectively.

---

## 🧲 Understanding Marketing

**Marketing** is how a business connects with customers, promotes its products, and understands market needs. It involves studying the **market size**, identifying **market segments** (like age groups, income levels), and designing a **marketing strategy** to reach them.

There are two main marketing approaches:
- **Mass marketing** targets a broad audience.
- **Niche marketing** focuses on a small, specific group.

**Market research** helps businesses gather information:
- **Primary research** is new data collected directly through surveys or interviews.
- **Secondary research** uses existing data like reports or statistics.

📦 The 4Ps of the Marketing Mix:
1. **Product** – What is being sold.
2. **Price** – How much it costs.
3. **Place** – Where and how it’s distributed.
4. **Promotion** – How people learn about the product.

All four elements must work together to satisfy customer needs.

## 🏢 Legal Structures of Business

The legal structure defines how a business is owned and managed:

- A **sole proprietorship** is run by one person who keeps all profits but also bears all the risks.
- A **partnership** is owned by two or more people who share profits and responsibilities.
- A **corporation** is a separate legal entity owned by shareholders. It's more complex but offers limited liability.

Choosing the right structure affects taxes, legal responsibility, and control.

---

## 🧠 SWOT Analysis

**SWOT** is a strategic planning tool that helps a business evaluate:

- **Strengths** – Internal advantages (e.g., skilled staff).
- **Weaknesses** – Internal limitations (e.g., outdated technology).
- **Opportunities** – External chances for success (e.g., new markets).
- **Threats** – External risks (e.g., competition, laws).

It helps businesses make informed decisions and reduce risks.

---

## 👥 Human Resources (HR)

HR manages people in a business. It involves recruitment, training, communication, motivation, and planning.

### Management Levels:
- **Top managers** make strategic decisions.
- **Middle managers** supervise teams.
- **Front-line managers** handle day-to-day operations.
- **Operatives** are the employees doing the actual work.

### Management Styles:
- **Autocratic** – Leader makes decisions alone.
- **Democratic** – Employees are involved in decision-making.
- **Laissez-faire** – Employees work independently with minimal control.

Effective HR ensures a motivated workforce and smooth operations.

---

## Production and Operations Management

This part of business focuses on how goods and services are created. Efficient **production methods** help businesses meet demand at low cost. These include:

- **Job production** – one-off items (e.g., custom furniture).
- **Batch production** – limited quantities in groups.
- **Mass production** – large-scale, repetitive manufacturing.

### Economies of Scale:
Larger businesses often enjoy lower costs per unit due to bulk buying and specialization. However, too much growth can lead to **diseconomies of scale**, where costs rise due to complexity or inefficiency.

---

## 💰 Accounting and Finance

This area tracks the money going in and out of the business.

- **Revenue** is the total money earned.
- **Profit** is what remains after subtracting expenses.
- A **Break-even point** is when total revenue equals total cost — no profit or loss.
- A **Balance sheet** shows the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity.
- **Budgeting** helps plan and control finances.

Proper financial planning is essential for survival and growth.

---

## 🌍 External Business Influences

External factors can’t be controlled but must be understood.

### Market Structures:
- **Perfect competition** – Many sellers, identical products.
- **Monopoly** – One seller controls the market.
- **Imperfect competition** – Some companies have influence over price.
- **Oligopoly** – A few firms dominate the market.

### Government Role:
- Sets business laws and regulations.
- Imposes taxes and offers incentives.
- Promotes fair competition and consumer rights.

### Business Ethics and Social Responsibility:
Modern businesses are expected to be ethical — treating customers, employees, and the environment responsibly.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People Are the Heart of Business

People are involved in every part of business:

- **Owners/shareholders** invest money expecting profits.
- **Managers** plan and lead operations.
- **Employees** contribute their skills and expect fair wages and conditions.
- **Consumers** pay for goods and expect value and reliability.

Business success depends on good relationships among all these people.

---

## 🎯 Business Profit – Two Views

- **Business profit** is simply total revenue minus total cost.
- **Economic profit** also subtracts **opportunity cost** — the value of the next best alternative that was given up.

Understanding both helps business leaders make better decisions.

---

## 🌐 Economic Systems Explained

Economic systems are how countries organize business and resource use.

- **Planned Economy**: Government owns most resources and decides what to produce. (Example: North Korea)
- **Socialism**: Government owns key industries but allows some private businesses. (Example: Sweden)
- **Free-Market Economy**: Buyers and sellers decide everything. (Example: USA)
- **Capitalism**: Private ownership and competition drive growth. (Example: New Zealand)
- **Mixed Economy**: A mix of government and private ownership. (Example: Bangladesh)

The right system depends on the country’s culture, politics, and resources.

---

## 📉 Inflation, Deflation, and Recession

- **Inflation**: A rise in prices over time — money loses value.
- **Deflation**: A fall in prices — money gains value.
- **Recession**: A period of economic decline — lower production, higher unemployment.

Businesses must plan for these changes to stay stable.

# 🧾 Lecture 2: Forms of Business Ownership

Understanding the different forms of business ownership is crucial for any entrepreneur or business student. The legal structure of a business affects daily operations, how taxes are paid, the level of control, and the risk involved. Choosing the right form depends on factors like business size, available capital, and long-term goals.

There are **three main types** of business ownership:
1. Sole Proprietorship
2. Partnership
3. Corporation

Each has its advantages, disadvantages, and legal characteristics.

---

## 1️⃣ Sole Proprietorship

A **sole proprietorship** is the simplest and most common form of business ownership. In this structure, one person owns and operates the business. There is **no legal separation** between the owner and the business, meaning the owner is personally responsible for all business debts and obligations.

Sole proprietors report business income and losses on their **personal tax returns**, and they are also subject to **self-employment taxes**. This form of business is often chosen by freelancers, small shop owners, and individual service providers.

### ✅ Advantages of Sole Proprietorship

- **Ease of Formation**: Starting a sole proprietorship is quick, inexpensive, and requires minimal legal formalities. As soon as the owner has a product or service, they can begin operating.
  
- **Retains All Profits**: The owner receives all profits earned, without sharing them with partners or shareholders.

- **Full Control**: All decisions are made by the owner. This allows for fast decision-making and flexibility.

- **Direct Customer Relations**: The owner often works closely with customers, gaining personal insight into their needs and building loyalty.

- **Ease of Dissolution**: Just as it is easy to start, the business can be ended without formal processes or documentation.

- **Employment Creation**: The business may create job opportunities within the community by hiring staff as it grows.

### ❌ Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorship

- **Unlimited Liability**: The owner is personally liable for all debts. If the business fails, personal assets like a house or savings may be used to cover debts.

- **Limited Funding**: The business relies on the owner's personal funds or loans. Banks may hesitate to lend to unproven single-owner businesses.

- **Lack of Specialized Skills**: One person may not be able to manage all business functions effectively (e.g., finance, marketing, law).

- **Limited Life**: If the owner dies or becomes incapacitated, the business usually ends. It cannot be inherited as a legal entity.

- **Lack of Large-Scale Economies**: The business may struggle to reduce costs through bulk buying or shared resources, unlike large companies.

---

## 2️⃣ Partnership

A **partnership** is a business owned by **two or more people** who share responsibility, decision-making, profits, and losses. It is formed through mutual agreement and is often formalized with a **partnership deed** — a legal document outlining the roles, contributions, and profit-sharing arrangements of each partner.

Partnerships are often chosen when people with complementary skills want to work together or when more capital and support are needed than one person can provide.

### ✅ Advantages of Partnership

- **Ease of Formation**: Like sole proprietorships, partnerships are relatively easy to form and do not require many legal formalities.

- **Pooling of Knowledge and Skills**: Partners bring different strengths (e.g., finance, operations, marketing) which enhance business success.

- **Risk Sharing**: All partners share business risks and losses, which can reduce the individual burden.

- **More Capital Available**: Combined resources from multiple partners allow better financial strength and creditworthiness.

- **Shared Responsibility**: Business duties can be divided based on expertise, making management more efficient.

- **Tax Advantages**: The partnership itself is not taxed; instead, profits are passed through to partners and taxed as personal income.

### ❌ Disadvantages of Partnership

- **Unlimited Liability**: In most partnerships, each partner is personally responsible for business debts, even if caused by another partner.

- **Loss of Autonomy**: Decisions must be made jointly, meaning no single partner has complete control.

- **Limited Life**: Partnerships often dissolve if a partner leaves, dies, or is unable to continue.

- **Potential for Conflict**: Disagreements may arise over work division, profit sharing, or strategic direction.

- **Difficult to Exit**: A partner cannot sell their share or leave the business without approval from other partners.

### 🧩 Types of Partnerships

1. **General Partnership (GP)** – All partners share equal responsibility and unlimited liability.
2. **Limited Partnership (LP)** – Some partners have limited liability (only responsible up to their investment).
3. **Joint Venture** – A temporary partnership formed for a specific project or time period.

---

## 3️⃣ Corporation

A **corporation** is a legal entity separate from its owners. It is created by registering with the state and is recognized as a distinct legal body. Ownership is divided into **shares**, and shareholders elect a **Board of Directors** to manage major decisions and hire professional managers.

Corporations are often used by large businesses seeking to raise significant capital or limit owner liability.

### ✅ Advantages of Corporation

- **Limited Liability**: Shareholders are only responsible for the money they invest; personal assets are not at risk.

- **Skilled Management**: Corporations can hire professional managers with experience and qualifications.

- **Transfer of Ownership**: Shares can be easily bought or sold, allowing flexibility and liquidity for investors.

- **Greater Access to Capital**: By issuing stock, corporations can raise large sums of money from many investors.

- **Perpetual Life**: The corporation continues to exist regardless of ownership changes or the death of shareholders.

- **Legal Entity Status**: Corporations can own assets, enter contracts, and sue or be sued independently from shareholders.

### ❌ Disadvantages of Corporation

- **Complex and Costly Formation**: Incorporating involves legal processes, paperwork, and fees, which can be expensive.

- **Limited Control**: Individual shareholders typically have little control beyond voting for board members.

- **Double Taxation**: The corporation pays taxes on profits, and shareholders pay taxes again on dividends received.

- **Government Regulation**: Corporations must meet many legal requirements and reporting standards, including audits and filings.

- **Lack of Secrecy**: Financial reports must be shared with shareholders, and for public companies, they become public knowledge.

- **Credit Limitations**: Creditors can only claim corporate assets, not shareholder assets, which may reduce loan availability.

---

## 🔗 Business Combinations

As companies grow, they may choose to combine with others to increase profits, market power, or efficiency. These combinations come in various forms:

### 🔹 Acquisition
An **acquisition** occurs when one company buys a majority share (usually more than 50%) of another company. This gives the acquiring company full control over the target company’s decisions.

**Example:** Unilever acquiring GSK Bangladesh or Akij Group acquiring Janata Jute Mills.

### 🔹 Merger
A **merger** is when two companies agree to unite into one new entity to improve financial or operational strength.

**Example:** Robi and Airtel merging into a single telecom company.

### 🔹 Amalgamation
An **amalgamation** forms a com
**Formula Example: **pletely **new company** by combining two or more businesses. Neither of the original companies remains; instead, a new legal entity is created.

Company A + Company B + Company C = Company D

## 1. The Value Delivery Process

The value delivery process is about how a company creates value for its customers and delivers it better than competitors. It is not just about selling products but about **understanding customers’ needs**, designing products/services accordingly, and then delivering them effectively.

Think of it as three main phases:

1. **Choosing the Value** – This is where a company decides **which customers to serve** and **what value to offer**.  
    Example: Apple deciding to target premium customers who want innovation and design.
    
2. **Providing the Value** – Here the company designs the product or service, sets the price, and makes it available in the market.  
    Example: Apple designing the iPhone, fixing the price, and distributing it globally.
    
3. **Communicating the Value** – The company must promote and communicate why customers should choose their product.  
    Example: Apple advertising “Think Different” to highlight uniqueness.
    

👉 In Bangla: Value delivery process মানে শুধু জিনিস বানানো আর বেচা নয়, বরং গ্রাহকের চাহিদা বোঝা → সেই অনুযায়ী জিনিস তৈরি করা → সঠিকভাবে পৌঁছে দেওয়া।

---

## 2. Porter’s Value Chain

Michael Porter introduced the **Value Chain Model** to explain how companies add value in each activity they do. It divides activities into **Primary Activities** and **Support Activities**.

### Primary Activities (Directly linked to creating the product/service)

- **Inbound Logistics** → সব কাঁচামাল আনা, storage, handling
    
- **Operations** → উৎপাদন প্রক্রিয়া (making the product)
    
- **Outbound Logistics** → গ্রাহকের কাছে পৌঁছে দেওয়া
    
- **Marketing & Sales** → বাজারে প্রচার, বিক্রয়
    
- **Service** → বিক্রির পর support (customer care, warranty)
    

### Support Activities (Help the primary activities)

- **Firm Infrastructure** → management, planning, finance
    
- **Human Resource Management** → কর্মচারী নিয়োগ ও উন্নয়ন
    
- **Technology Development** → নতুন প্রযুক্তি, research
    
- **Procurement** → সরবরাহকারী থেকে জিনিস কেনা
    

👉 The idea is: each activity can add value. If all are managed well, the company gains **competitive advantage**.

---

## 3. Industry & Market Scopes

When companies make strategies, they must decide their **scope** – অর্থাৎ কোন বাজারে, কোন পণ্য নিয়ে, কোন এলাকায় কাজ করবে।

### a) **Industry Scope**

Defines in which **industry** the company will compete.  
Example: Samsung is in the **electronics industry** (phones, TVs, chips).

### b) **Product/Application Scope**

Decides what kind of **products** or applications to offer.  
Example: Adobe offers software for **design & creativity applications** (Photoshop, Illustrator).

### c) **Competence Scope**

Focuses on **what the company is good at** (skills/strengths).  
Example: Tesla’s competence = electric vehicle technology & battery innovation.

### d) **Market-Segment Scope**

Which group of customers (segment) to target.  
Example: Rolex targets the **luxury segment**.

### e) **Vertical Scope**

How much of the supply chain the company controls.  
Example: Amazon has wide vertical scope – they sell (retail), store (warehouses), deliver (logistics).

### f) **Geographic Scope**

Which regions/countries the company will serve.  
Example: McDonald’s operates worldwide, but menus vary by geography (চীন-এ rice dish, ভারতে paneer burger)।

## 4. Ansoff’s Product-Market Expansion Grid

This model explains **growth strategies** for companies. It has four options:

||**Existing Products**|**New Products**|
|---|---|---|
|**Existing Markets**|**Market Penetration** (increase sales with same products)|**Product Development** (create new products for same customers)|
|**New Markets**|**Market Development** (take existing products to new markets)|**Diversification** (new products in new markets)|

# Economics, Small Business & Strategic Management

## 1. Understanding the Economy

The **economy** is the total amount of all economic activities in a region. Simply, it is the system through which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed. The study of how society manages its limited resources is called **economics**.

Economics has two main branches. **Microeconomics** looks at small details, such as how individuals, businesses, and industries decide the demand and supply of products at different prices. **Macroeconomics**, on the other hand, looks at the bigger picture, such as government policies, overall resource distribution, and how industries interact with each other.

One of the most important ideas in economics is **scarcity**. Resources like money, land, and time are always limited. Because of scarcity, we must make choices, and every choice has an **opportunity cost**. Opportunity cost means the value of the best alternative you did not choose. (বাংলায়: যদি তুমি একটা কাজ বেছে নাও, তখন যে ভালো সুযোগটা ত্যাগ করলে সেটাই opportunity cost)।

---

## 2. Demand and Supply

Economic activity is mostly controlled by two forces: **demand** and **supply**. Demand means the willingness and ability of buyers to purchase goods at different prices. Supply means the amount of goods sellers are willing and able to produce at different prices.

When demand is shown on a graph, it normally slopes downward, because people usually buy more when prices are low and less when prices are high. However, the **demand curve** can shift. If people’s income increases, if they like the product more, or if substitutes (similar products) become more expensive, then demand shifts to the right (higher demand). If the opposite happens, demand shifts to the left (lower demand).

Supply is also shown on a graph and usually slopes upward, because producers want to sell more when prices are higher. If technology improves or production cost decreases, the supply curve shifts to the right. If costs rise or competition increases, supply may shift to the left.

The point where demand and supply meet is called the **equilibrium point**. At this price, the quantity buyers want equals the quantity sellers provide, so there is no shortage or surplus.

---

## 3. Factors of Production

Every business or economy needs certain inputs, called the **factors of production**. These include:

- **Natural resources** such as land, forests, minerals, and water.
    
- **Human resources**, meaning the people who work in an organization.
    
- **Capital**, which includes both money for financing and physical tools such as factories and machines.
    
- **Entrepreneurship**, which is the innovation, leadership, and risk-taking ability to start and run businesses.
    

---

## 4. Small Business and Its Importance

A **small business** is a company that is independently owned, not dominant in its field, and usually employs fewer than 500 people. Although small in size, these businesses play a big role in the economy.

Most small businesses are focused on a narrow area and operate with limited resources. But this limitation often makes them more innovative, flexible, and quicker in making decisions compared to large companies.

Economically, small businesses are very important. They provide jobs to millions of people, introduce new and creative products, support larger organizations by supplying goods and services, and bring fresh money into the economy. They are also more willing to take risks that big companies may avoid.

---

## 5. Why People Start Their Own Business

People often start businesses because they want more control over their future and are tired of working under someone else. Some do it out of passion for a product idea, or because they want to follow personal goals and dreams. Others may start simply because they cannot find good job opportunities.

---

## 6. Business Planning

To succeed, new businesses usually need a **business plan**. This is a written document that describes what the business will do, what its goals are, and how it will achieve them. A proper plan includes the mission of the business, company overview, description of products and services, information about managers, target customers, marketing strategy, operations plan, financial projections, and possible risks.

Without a good plan, businesses often fail. Common reasons for failure include poor leadership, lack of proper marketing, overdependence on one customer, weak financial management, and bad inventory or location decisions.

---

## 7. Financing Small Businesses

Starting a business requires money, known as capital. Entrepreneurs can get this money from many sources. **Seed money** is the first small investment to get started. **Microlenders** give small loans to people who may not qualify for regular bank loans. **Venture capitalists (VCs)** invest large amounts of money but usually want part of the company in return. **Angel investors** are wealthy individuals who invest smaller amounts earlier in the life of a business. Another option is an **IPO (Initial Public Offering)**, where a company sells its shares to the public. In recent times, **crowdfunding** has become popular, where money is collected from many people online.

---

## 8. Franchising

Another way to do business is through a **franchise**. Here, one company (the franchisee) buys the rights from another company (the franchisor) to sell its products and use its system.

The advantages are that the franchisee gets brand recognition, national advertising, and a tested formula for success. But there are disadvantages too, such as less freedom to make decisions and having to follow the franchisor’s rules strictly.

---

## 9. Marketing and Customer Value

In marketing, the goal is to give **customer value**. This means customers feel that the benefits they receive are greater than the costs they pay. **Customer perceived value (CPV)** is the difference between what customers think they gain (benefits) and what they give up (costs). Benefits can be economic (money saved), functional (usefulness), or psychological (status or happiness). Costs can include price, time, effort, and even disposal of the product.

So, a business must always focus on making customers satisfied by increasing total value and reducing total cost.

---

## 10. Strategic Planning in Business

Big companies cannot manage all their businesses with one single plan, so they use **strategic planning**. First, they define a clear **mission statement**, which explains why the company exists and what it aims to do. Then, they create **Strategic Business Units (SBUs)**. An SBU is like a mini-company inside the big company, with its own strategy, competitors, and manager responsible for profits.

To decide how to manage SBUs, managers use tools like the **BCG Growth-Share Matrix**. This matrix divides businesses into four categories:

- **Stars** – high market share and high growth, which must be maintained.
    
- **Cash Cows** – high market share but low growth, which generate steady profit.
    
- **Question Marks** – high growth but low market share, which need investment.
    
- **Dogs** – low growth and low share, which should be sold off.
    

Companies also look for growth in three ways. **Intensive growth** focuses on selling more of current products or creating new products for current markets (Ansoff Matrix). **Integrative growth** means growing by buying or combining with other companies in the same industry (backward, forward, horizontal). **Diversification growth** means entering completely new markets. Diversification can be concentric (related products), horizontal (new products for same customers), or conglomerate (completely unrelated).

---

## 11. The Strategic Management Process

The **strategic management process** is a continuous cycle that helps companies plan and survive in competitive markets. It has six steps:

1. Identifying the mission, goals, and current strategies of the company.
    
2. Doing an **external analysis** to find opportunities and threats in the environment.
    
3. Doing an **internal analysis** to find strengths and weaknesses of the company. Together, steps 2 and 3 form a **SWOT analysis** (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).
    
4. Formulating strategies by matching strengths with opportunities and defending against threats.
    
5. Implementing strategies by adjusting the organization’s structure and activities.
    
6. Evaluating results to see if the strategies worked, and making changes if necessary.
    

This process shows that good strategy is not just about planning but also about adapting and improving continuously.
