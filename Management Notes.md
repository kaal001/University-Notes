# Business Studies – Beginner to Exam-Ready Note

---

## What is Business?

A **business** is an organized economic activity where individuals or groups produce, buy, or sell goods and services with the primary goal of making a profit. It also plays an important role in satisfying the needs and wants of people in society. Businesses are not just about selling products — they also solve problems, create jobs, support communities, and keep the economy running.

The nature of a business can vary depending on what it offers (goods or services), how it is owned (sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation), and what kind of roles it provides (managerial, technical, operational, etc.). At its core, every business aims to provide value while also generating income.

---

## What Do Businesses Actually Do?

Businesses are usually created by **entrepreneurs** — people who see a gap in the market and build a product or service to meet that need. To do this, businesses must use **inputs** (such as land, labour, capital, and machinery) to produce **outputs** (finished goods or services).

They need to manage their **resources** efficiently to keep costs low and quality high. A successful business will **generate profits**, but to do that, it must also maintain strong relationships with its stakeholders, provide value to customers, and adapt to changes in the environment.

Businesses also impact society in other ways. They offer jobs, pay taxes, create infrastructure, and contribute to the development of the local and global economy.

---

## Who Are the Stakeholders?

**Stakeholders** are individuals or groups who are directly or indirectly affected by the business or have an interest in its success. For example:

- **Customers** want quality products at fair prices.
- **Employees** want fair wages, job security, and a safe workplace.
- **Managers** are responsible for decision-making and ensuring operations run smoothly.
- **Owners** or shareholders invest capital and expect profits in return.
- **Suppliers** provide the goods and materials businesses need.
- **Governments** regulate businesses, collect taxes, and protect public interest.
- **Communities** expect businesses to operate ethically and contribute to social development.
- **Creditors** lend money and want it repaid with interest.

Each stakeholder has different expectations, and balancing them is key to long-term success.

---

## What is an Industry?

An **industry** is a collection of businesses that produce similar products or services. For instance, car manufacturers and auto parts producers are part of the **automobile industry**. Industries help organize the economy and create competition among businesses. Understanding the industry helps a business position itself, understand the competition, and plan strategies for growth.

---

## Internal and External Influences

Business performance is shaped by two types of factors:

- **Internal influences** come from within the business. This includes management style, employee skills, financial resources, company culture, etc.
- **External influences** come from outside and include competition, market demand, laws, social trends, economic conditions, and technology.

Understanding both is crucial for decision-making and long-term planning.

---

## Objectives and Strategy

Every business sets goals called **objectives**. Common objectives include:

- **Profit** – To earn more revenue than costs.
- **Survival** – Especially important for startups or during economic crises.
- **Growth** – Businesses aim to expand their size, reach, and market share.
- **Social responsibility** – Many modern businesses also aim to be ethical and sustainable.

To achieve these objectives, businesses design a **strategy** — a set of long-term plans and decisions about how to compete, where to operate, and how to use resources effectively.

---

## Understanding Marketing

**Marketing** is how a business connects with customers, promotes its products, and understands market needs. It involves studying the **market size**, identifying **market segments** (like age groups, income levels), and designing a **marketing strategy** to reach them.

There are two main marketing approaches:
- **Mass marketing** targets a broad audience.
- **Niche marketing** focuses on a small, specific group.

**Market research** helps businesses gather information:
- **Primary research** is new data collected directly through surveys or interviews.
- **Secondary research** uses existing data like reports or statistics.

### The 4Ps of the Marketing Mix:
1. **Product** – What is being sold.
2. **Price** – How much it costs.
3. **Place** – Where and how it’s distributed.
4. **Promotion** – How people learn about the product.

All four elements must work together to satisfy customer needs.

---

## Legal Structures of Business

The legal structure defines how a business is owned and managed:

- A **sole proprietorship** is run by one person who keeps all profits but also bears all the risks.
- A **partnership** is owned by two or more people who share profits and responsibilities.
- A **corporation** is a separate legal entity owned by shareholders. It's more complex but offers limited liability.

Choosing the right structure affects taxes, legal responsibility, and control.

---

## SWOT Analysis

**SWOT** is a strategic planning tool that helps a business evaluate:

- **Strengths** – Internal advantages (e.g., skilled staff).
- **Weaknesses** – Internal limitations (e.g., outdated technology).
- **Opportunities** – External chances for success (e.g., new markets).
- **Threats** – External risks (e.g., competition, laws).

It helps businesses make informed decisions and reduce risks.

---

## Human Resources (HR)

HR manages people in a business. It involves recruitment, training, communication, motivation, and planning.

### Management Levels:
- **Top managers** make strategic decisions.
- **Middle managers** supervise teams.
- **Front-line managers** handle day-to-day operations.
- **Operatives** are the employees doing the actual work.

### Management Styles:
- **Autocratic** – Leader makes decisions alone.
- **Democratic** – Employees are involved in decision-making.
- **Laissez-faire** – Employees work independently with minimal control.

Effective HR ensures a motivated workforce and smooth operations.

---

## Production and Operations Management

This part of business focuses on how goods and services are created. Efficient **production methods** help businesses meet demand at low cost. These include:

- **Job production** – one-off items (e.g., custom furniture).
- **Batch production** – limited quantities in groups.
- **Mass production** – large-scale, repetitive manufacturing.

### Economies of Scale:
Larger businesses often enjoy lower costs per unit due to bulk buying and specialization. However, too much growth can lead to **diseconomies of scale**, where costs rise due to complexity or inefficiency.

---

## Accounting and Finance

This area tracks the money going in and out of the business.

- **Revenue** is the total money earned.
- **Profit** is what remains after subtracting expenses.
- A **Break-even point** is when total revenue equals total cost — no profit or loss.
- A **Balance sheet** shows the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity.
- **Budgeting** helps plan and control finances.

Proper financial planning is essential for survival and growth.

---

## External Business Influences

External factors can’t be controlled but must be understood.

### Market Structures:
- **Perfect competition** – Many sellers, identical products.
- **Monopoly** – One seller controls the market.
- **Imperfect competition** – Some companies have influence over price.
- **Oligopoly** – A few firms dominate the market.

### Government Role:
- Sets business laws and regulations.
- Imposes taxes and offers incentives.
- Promotes fair competition and consumer rights.

### Business Ethics and Social Responsibility:
Modern businesses are expected to be ethical — treating customers, employees, and the environment responsibly.

---

## People Are the Heart of Business

People are involved in every part of business:

- **Owners/shareholders** invest money expecting profits.
- **Managers** plan and lead operations.
- **Employees** contribute their skills and expect fair wages and conditions.
- **Consumers** pay for goods and expect value and reliability.

Business success depends on good relationships among all these people.

---

## Business Profit – Two Views

- **Business profit** is simply total revenue minus total cost.
- **Economic profit** also subtracts **opportunity cost** — the value of the next best alternative that was given up.

Understanding both helps business leaders make better decisions.

---

## Economic Systems Explained

Economic systems are how countries organize business and resource use.

- **Planned Economy**: Government owns most resources and decides what to produce. (Example: North Korea)
- **Socialism**: Government owns key industries but allows some private businesses. (Example: Sweden)
- **Free-Market Economy**: Buyers and sellers decide everything. (Example: USA)
- **Capitalism**: Private ownership and competition drive growth. (Example: New Zealand)
- **Mixed Economy**: A mix of government and private ownership. (Example: Bangladesh)

The right system depends on the country’s culture, politics, and resources.


## Inflation, Deflation, and Recession

- **Inflation**: A rise in prices over time — money loses value.
- **Deflation**: A fall in prices — money gains value.
- **Recession**: A period of economic decline — lower production, higher unemployment.

Businesses must plan for these changes to stay stable.

# 🧾 Lecture 2: Forms of Business Ownership

Understanding the different forms of business ownership is crucial for any entrepreneur or business student. The legal structure of a business affects daily operations, how taxes are paid, the level of control, and the risk involved. Choosing the right form depends on factors like business size, available capital, and long-term goals.

There are **three main types** of business ownership:
1. Sole Proprietorship
2. Partnership
3. Corporation

Each has its advantages, disadvantages, and legal characteristics.

---

## Sole Proprietorship

A **sole proprietorship** is the simplest and most common form of business ownership. In this structure, one person owns and operates the business. There is **no legal separation** between the owner and the business, meaning the owner is personally responsible for all business debts and obligations.

Sole proprietors report business income and losses on their **personal tax returns**, and they are also subject to **self-employment taxes**. This form of business is often chosen by freelancers, small shop owners, and individual service providers.

### Advantages of Sole Proprietorship

- **Ease of Formation**: Starting a sole proprietorship is quick, inexpensive, and requires minimal legal formalities. As soon as the owner has a product or service, they can begin operating.
  
- **Retains All Profits**: The owner receives all profits earned, without sharing them with partners or shareholders.

- **Full Control**: All decisions are made by the owner. This allows for fast decision-making and flexibility.

- **Direct Customer Relations**: The owner often works closely with customers, gaining personal insight into their needs and building loyalty.

- **Ease of Dissolution**: Just as it is easy to start, the business can be ended without formal processes or documentation.

- **Employment Creation**: The business may create job opportunities within the community by hiring staff as it grows.

### Disadvantages of Sole Proprietorship

- **Unlimited Liability**: The owner is personally liable for all debts. If the business fails, personal assets like a house or savings may be used to cover debts.

- **Limited Funding**: The business relies on the owner's personal funds or loans. Banks may hesitate to lend to unproven single-owner businesses.

- **Lack of Specialized Skills**: One person may not be able to manage all business functions effectively (e.g., finance, marketing, law).

- **Limited Life**: If the owner dies or becomes incapacitated, the business usually ends. It cannot be inherited as a legal entity.

- **Lack of Large-Scale Economies**: The business may struggle to reduce costs through bulk buying or shared resources, unlike large companies.

---

## Partnership

A **partnership** is a business owned by **two or more people** who share responsibility, decision-making, profits, and losses. It is formed through mutual agreement and is often formalized with a **partnership deed** — a legal document outlining the roles, contributions, and profit-sharing arrangements of each partner.

Partnerships are often chosen when people with complementary skills want to work together or when more capital and support are needed than one person can provide.

### Advantages of Partnership

- **Ease of Formation**: Like sole proprietorships, partnerships are relatively easy to form and do not require many legal formalities.

- **Pooling of Knowledge and Skills**: Partners bring different strengths (e.g., finance, operations, marketing) which enhance business success.

- **Risk Sharing**: All partners share business risks and losses, which can reduce the individual burden.

- **More Capital Available**: Combined resources from multiple partners allow better financial strength and creditworthiness.

- **Shared Responsibility**: Business duties can be divided based on expertise, making management more efficient.

- **Tax Advantages**: The partnership itself is not taxed; instead, profits are passed through to partners and taxed as personal income.

### Disadvantages of Partnership

- **Unlimited Liability**: In most partnerships, each partner is personally responsible for business debts, even if caused by another partner.

- **Loss of Autonomy**: Decisions must be made jointly, meaning no single partner has complete control.

- **Limited Life**: Partnerships often dissolve if a partner leaves, dies, or is unable to continue.

- **Potential for Conflict**: Disagreements may arise over work division, profit sharing, or strategic direction.

- **Difficult to Exit**: A partner cannot sell their share or leave the business without approval from other partners.

### 🧩 Types of Partnerships

1. **General Partnership (GP)** – All partners share equal responsibility and unlimited liability.
2. **Limited Partnership (LP)** – Some partners have limited liability (only responsible up to their investment).
3. **Joint Venture** – A temporary partnership formed for a specific project or time period.

---

## 3️⃣ Corporation

A **corporation** is a legal entity separate from its owners. It is created by registering with the state and is recognized as a distinct legal body. Ownership is divided into **shares**, and shareholders elect a **Board of Directors** to manage major decisions and hire professional managers.

Corporations are often used by large businesses seeking to raise significant capital or limit owner liability.

### ✅ Advantages of Corporation

- **Limited Liability**: Shareholders are only responsible for the money they invest; personal assets are not at risk.

- **Skilled Management**: Corporations can hire professional managers with experience and qualifications.

- **Transfer of Ownership**: Shares can be easily bought or sold, allowing flexibility and liquidity for investors.

- **Greater Access to Capital**: By issuing stock, corporations can raise large sums of money from many investors.

- **Perpetual Life**: The corporation continues to exist regardless of ownership changes or the death of shareholders.

- **Legal Entity Status**: Corporations can own assets, enter contracts, and sue or be sued independently from shareholders.

### ❌ Disadvantages of Corporation

- **Complex and Costly Formation**: Incorporating involves legal processes, paperwork, and fees, which can be expensive.

- **Limited Control**: Individual shareholders typically have little control beyond voting for board members.

- **Double Taxation**: The corporation pays taxes on profits, and shareholders pay taxes again on dividends received.

- **Government Regulation**: Corporations must meet many legal requirements and reporting standards, including audits and filings.

- **Lack of Secrecy**: Financial reports must be shared with shareholders, and for public companies, they become public knowledge.

- **Credit Limitations**: Creditors can only claim corporate assets, not shareholder assets, which may reduce loan availability.

## Business Combinations

As companies grow, they may choose to combine with others to increase profits, market power, or efficiency. These combinations come in various forms:

### Acquisition
An **acquisition** occurs when one company buys a majority share (usually more than 50%) of another company. This gives the acquiring company full control over the target company’s decisions.

**Example:** Unilever acquiring GSK Bangladesh or Akij Group acquiring Janata Jute Mills.

### Merger
A **merger** is when two companies agree to unite into one new entity to improve financial or operational strength.

**Example:** Robi and Airtel merging into a single telecom company.

### Amalgamation
An **amalgamation** forms a completely **new company** by combining two or more businesses. Neither of the original companies remains; instead, a new legal entity is created.

**Formula Example:**
Company A + Company B + Company C = Company D
