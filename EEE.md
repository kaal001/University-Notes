# Differentiate between majority and minority carriers in semiconductors.

- **Definition:**  
    Majority carriers are the charge carriers present in the highest concentration in a semiconductor. Minority carriers are the ones present in much smaller numbers.
    
- **In n-type semiconductors:**  
    Electrons are the majority carriers as they are contributed by donor atoms, while holes are the minority carriers generated thermally.
    
- **In p-type semiconductors:**  
    Holes serve as the majority carriers due to acceptor atom doping, and electrons become the minority carriers through thermal generation.

# Define extrinsic semiconductor and explain the creation of n-type and p-type semiconductor materials.


![[Pasted image 20250801013612.png]]

An **extrinsic semiconductor** is made by adding a small amount of impurity to a pure semiconductor like silicon. This process is called **doping** and it increases the material’s ability to conduct electricity by adding more charge carriers (electrons or holes).

An **n-type semiconductor** is created by adding elements with **five valence electrons** (like phosphorus or arsenic) to silicon. Four electrons form bonds, and the **extra electron becomes free** to move and carry current. In this case, **electrons are the main (majority) carriers**, so it’s called “n-type” (negative type).

A **p-type semiconductor** is made by adding elements with **three valence electrons** (like boron or gallium). These atoms leave an **empty space or "hole"** in the crystal. These holes act like **positive charge carriers**, and in this material, **holes are the majority carriers**. That’s why it’s called “p-type” (positive type).

# Describe the formation of the depletion region in a semiconductor junction and explain how it is created.

![[Pasted image 20250801014004.png]]

When a p-type and an n-type semiconductor are joined, a special area called the **depletion region** forms at the junction. In the p-type side, there are many **holes** (positive carriers), and in the n-type side, there are many **electrons** (negative carriers). After they are connected, electrons move to the p-side and holes move to the n-side. When they meet, they **recombine** and cancel each other out.

This recombination leaves behind **fixed ions** that cannot move. These ions create an **electric field** that stops more electrons and holes from moving across the junction. As a result, a region forms with **no free carriers**, called the **depletion region**. This area acts like an **insulator** and is very important for how diodes and other semiconductor devices work. The thickness of this region depends on how much each side is doped.

# Interpret Shockley’s equation under different biasing conditions for a silicon diode.

The **Shockley diode equation** is:

$$
I = I_S \left( e^{\frac{V}{nV_T}} - 1 \right)
$$

**Where:**

- \( I \) = Current through the diode  
- \( I_S \) = Reverse saturation current  
- \( V \) = Voltage across the diode  
- \( V_T \) = Thermal voltage (≈ 26 mV at room temperature)  
- \( n \) = Ideality factor (typically 1 to 2 for silicon)

### Forward Bias

Under **forward bias**, the voltage \( V \) is positive. The exponential term becomes large, and the current increases rapidly. For silicon diodes, the forward threshold is around 0.7 V, beyond which the diode conducts significantly. In this case, the equation simplifies to:

$$
I \approx I_S e^{\frac{V}{nV_T}}
$$

### Reverse Bias

Under **reverse bias**, the voltage \( V \) is negative. The exponential term approaches zero, and the current becomes approximately:

$$
I \approx -I_S
$$

This represents a very small leakage current (reverse saturation current) and shows that the diode blocks current flow effectively in reverse bias.

### Zero Bias

At **zero bias** (i.e., when \( V = 0 \)), the current is:

$$
I = I_S (e^0 - 1) = 0
$$

Thus, no current flows through the diode at zero voltage.

# Sketch and explain the I-V characteristics curve for semiconductor diodes.
![[Pasted image 20250801015636.png]]
The **I-V (current-voltage) characteristics** of a diode show how current changes with applied voltage. The curve has two main regions: **forward bias** and **reverse bias**.
### Forward Bias
- The **p-side** is connected to the **positive** terminal, and the **n-side** to the **negative**.
- After a threshold voltage (≈ **0.7V for silicon**, **0.3V for germanium**), the diode starts to conduct significantly.
- Current increases **exponentially** beyond this point (called the **knee voltage**).
- Below the threshold, only a small current flows.
### Reverse Bias
- The **p-side** is connected to the **negative**, and the **n-side** to the **positive** terminal.
- Only a **tiny reverse saturation current** flows due to minority carriers.
- The diode blocks most current.
- If the **reverse voltage** exceeds the **breakdown voltage**, current increases sharply (may damage the diode unless it’s a **Zener** type).

# Sketch and explain the I-V characteristics curve for Zener diodes.
![[Pasted image 20250801020507.png]]
A **Zener diode** is a special type of diode designed to operate in both forward and reverse bias conditions. Its I-V characteristics are divided into two main regions: forward bias and reverse bias.

In the **forward bias region**, when the positive terminal is connected to the p-side and the negative to the n-side, the Zener diode behaves like a regular diode. It allows current to flow easily after a small threshold voltage is reached, typically around 0.7V for silicon. As the voltage increases beyond this point, the current also increases rapidly.

In the **reverse bias region**, when the p-side is connected to the negative terminal, the diode initially allows only a small leakage current to flow. However, once the reverse voltage reaches a specific value known as the Zener breakdown voltage (Vz), the diode starts conducting a large reverse current. This reverse conduction does not damage the diode, unlike in normal diodes. Instead, the Zener diode maintains a nearly constant voltage across it, making it ideal for voltage regulation and protection circuits.

# Describe breakdown mechanism for semiconductor diodes/ avalanche breakdown.
![[Pasted image 20250801021353.png]]

In reverse bias, when the voltage across a diode becomes very high, the small current in the diode speeds up. These fast-moving charges hit atoms and knock out more electrons. This creates a chain reaction, causing a sudden large current. This is called **avalanche breakdown**. 

If the diode is heavily doped, breakdown can happen at a lower voltage. At very low voltages (below 5V), a strong electric field can break atomic bonds and create more carriers. This is called **Zener breakdown**. Both effects cause a sharp increase in current, but in normal diodes, this region should be avoided unless the diode is made for it, like in **Zener diodes**.

# Describe breakdown mechanism for zener diodes/ zener breakdown.

![[Pasted image 20250801020507.png]]
**Zener breakdown** happens in a Zener diode when it is reverse biased and the reverse voltage becomes very low (usually less than 5V). At this low voltage, a very strong electric field is created across the thin depletion region. This electric field is so strong that it breaks the bonds between atoms and pulls electrons out, creating free charge carriers. As a result, a large reverse current suddenly flows. This sharp increase in current at a specific voltage is called Zener breakdown. Zener diodes are specially designed to work safely in this region and are used to regulate voltage in circuits.
